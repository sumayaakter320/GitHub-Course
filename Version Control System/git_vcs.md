# Git is a distributed version control system

```markdownlint
In Git, the version database is called a repository. The different versions are identified by commits. A commit means
that you saved a change of your source code. When you copy the repository from the server to your computer, it means
in Git terms that you clone the repository to your machine.

In this course you will learn about cloning

a repository and about pushing and pulling changes.

The server computer that we will use is GitHub.com.

There you can create remote repositories for free.

But before working with a remote repository on GitHub.com,

you will learn how to work with Git locally on your machine.

With Git,

you can start with a local repository and you can commit your

changes there and learn how to use Git on your machine.

At a later stage, you can push your local repository to a remote repository,

for example, on GitHub.com.

This is actually what we will do in this course.

Alright, now you learned about the three types of version control systems.
